This is a webapp that allows multiple users to add accounts and transactions etc and manage there finances.

# Use

- This webapp integrates with the https://github.com/benfl3713/finance-api to manage all data.
- It is required that both this and the finance-api are running and connected together in order to load any data. To do so add the api url to the config.json file in the assets folder. (You will need to create it for the first time, there is a demo one in the same folder)
- You can easily run this in docker using the image: benfl3713/finance-manager and also run the api image which is detailed in the api repo
